- Explain the use case and why this feature would be useful to others.

   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. **Run interactive login**:

---

## Coding & Style Standards

- **ES Modules**: Use native `import`/`export` syntax. No CommonJS `require()`.
- **Node.js Target**: Minimum Node.js v20.0.0.
- **Fail-Fast Error Strategy**: Explicit error messages with non-zero exit codes (`process.exit(1)`) on critical failures.
- **Clean Formatting**: Use standard 2-space indentation and descriptive variable names.
- **JSDoc Comments**: Document public functions with JSDoc parameter and return types.

---

## Testing Directives

All submitted code MUST pass the built-in Node.js test runner:

```bash
npm test
```

Ensure all unit tests in `test/check.js` pass with 0 errors before requesting a PR review.

---

## Security Reminders

- **NEVER** commit `storageState.json` or `.env` files.
- Ensure all personal tokens (`GH_TOKEN`, `COMMIT_READ_TOKEN`) are masked in issue descriptions and PR logs.
